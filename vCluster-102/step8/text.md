# Tenancy Model Overview

vClusters support multiple workload placement models depending on your isolation needs.

## The Three Main Tenancy Modes:

1. **Shared Nodes** — All vCluster workloads run on the same nodes  
2. **Dedicated Nodes** — Each vCluster gets specific nodes via nodeSelectors  
3. **Private Nodes + Autonodes** — vClusters get exclusive nodes with auto-scaling  

Each model balances cost, performance, and security differently.

This is what you'll explore in the next steps.
