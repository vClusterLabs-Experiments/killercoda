# Shared Nodes

In Shared Node tenancy, all workloads—including Pods from multiple vClusters—run on the same underlying node pool.

## Benefits:

- Very cost-efficient
- Minimal complexity
- Perfect for dev environments or experiments

## Downsides:

- Potential noisy-neighbor issues
- Tenants share compute resources
- Not ideal for regulated workloads
